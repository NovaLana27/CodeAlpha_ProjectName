# CodeAlpha_ProjectName
This repository contains my CodeAlpha internship project featuring an Age Calculator and a To Do List built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Both applications use DOM manipulation and browser localStorage to save user data, update content dynamically, and retain changes after refresh or revisit. Focus is on clean logic and usability.
